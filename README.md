# About The Project


<br />

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Onay is a security system that secures your token approvals by monitoring the contract security breaches and react by revoking the permissions for you if a smart contract exploit is detected. Without compromising any custody.

Onay means "Approval" in Turkish and took inspiration from the streets of Instanbul.

<!-- GETTING STARTED   -->


# Getting Started


To get started with Onay, follow these steps:

1. Connect your Safe Wallet to the Onay dapp at [onay-app.vercel.app](https://onay-app.vercel.app/)

2. See the different token approvals you gave to the different contracts per token and network.

3. Secure your token approvals by adding OnlyModule to your Safe through the dapp. It gives the Security Council permission to revoke your approval in case of a security breach in a Smart Contract.

4. If a security breack happens the Security Council revokes your approvals inmediatly, even if you are sleeping, keeping your funds SAFU.

## The Security Council 

The Security Council is a Multi-Sig conformed by DAOs, security organizations and independent security researchers. Any member of the Council has permissions to hit the Red Button. Which will execute bulk revokes in one transaction for the potentially affected wallets. Since the Security Council can only revoke allowances, there is no extra risk to use this module. The worst harm it can do is to revoke all your allowances for no reason, but there is no incentive nor benefit to do so.
