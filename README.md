# About The Project


<br />

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Onay is a security system that secures your token approvals by monitoring the contract security breaches and react by revoking the permissions for you.

Onay means "Approval" in Turkish and took inspiration from the streets of Instanbul.

2. See the different token approvalls you gave to the different ententies per asset and network.

3. Secure your token approvals by committing a Safe transaction that ensures we have a permission to revoke your approval in case of a security breach.
